#Uncomment-Technique-for-RWD

* * *

##What is this repo?
This is a working example of the uncomment technique first provided by [Moritz Giessmann](http://moritz-giessmann.de) on [Code Pen](http://codepen.io/MoritzGiessmann/pen/LcfdH).


###Technique / Usage
The structure will allow you to keep your html in one palce while building a responsive site. With one set of markup you can comment sections you want to progressivly enhance at larger viewports. Because commentend code will not be rendered this keeps your page weight light for smaller bandwidth devices.

This approach also keeps you HTML all in one place, resolving pains with remote HTML in JS files.
